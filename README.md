This Random Password Generator will help you create a random password based on the criteria that you choose. 

## HOW TO USE:
To create a random password, set your password criteria and click the Generate Password button.

**Setting Your Criteria:**

**Length** - 
Use the slider to adjust the length of your password. All passwords must be between 8 and 128 characters long. 8 is the default length.

One of the following criteria MUST BE CHECKED or a password will not be created:
* **Uppercase** - select this option to include uppercase characters.
* **Lowercase** - select this option to include lowercase characters.
* **Numbers** - select this option to include numbers.
* **Special** - select this option to include special characters.

    *note -  The use of Special Characters may cause line-breaks in the text-area when longer than 33 characters, but will still copy properly inline to the clipboard*

**GENERATE PASSWORD** - 
Once your criteria has been set, click the Generate Password button and a randomly generated password will be created in the text area.

**COPY TO CLIPBOARD** - 
Use the Copy to Clipboard button to copy your randomly generated password to your clipboard so that you can paste it elsewhere for safe keeping.
